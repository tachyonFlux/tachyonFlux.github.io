Green Fields sports a pool that resembles a natural pond as well as a stream. This stream starts in an artificial waterfall from the back of a cave called the Grotto (area A2b) at the park’s southern end, flowing out of the pond and then under the path near the dock hallway. The water passes into the BoundlessSunroom (area B1) and then circulates through water filtration tanks in area B13 back into the waterfall. Two stairways allow access to the top of the waterfall, facilitating access to the walking path behind the waterfall and the diving boards above it. The Grotto has a bar and two climbing walls at its opening, one to the north and a smaller one near the maintenance cave (area A2a).</td>

                        <td class="u-table-cell">The Loop is a recreational walkway that encircles the main floor, offering easy access to the various shops and theaters. Many windows along the Loop show holographic images of strange and beautiful landscapes or, with a request to Keys to Elysium, actual views of the asteroid outside. Loop Runners (area A3a), a shop just outside of Green Fields, is the official starting&nbsp; point of the Loop and offers guests access to light personal transport, such as bicycles, trikes, and skates. Guests can acquire either muscle-powered or self-propelled versions of these vehicles, depending on needs and preferences.</td>

Contemplation boasts many skylights and a terrace open to the Loop, overlooking the dome above the Boundless Sunroom. The terrace also sports a gravity chute (area A4a) that allows a guest to leap into the chute anddrop harmlessly into the sunroom.</td>

In addition to a sundries shop, the market contains a holographic fashion boutique with cleaning and tailoring services, a multicultural grocery that includes a mk 3 culinary synthesizer, and a high-end gift shop that contains small-scale 3-D printing facilities.

of the current that is ideal for resting or wading. Within this
